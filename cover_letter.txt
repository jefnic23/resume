Hello,

My name is Jeff Nicholas, I'm a musician and self-taught programmer. I got my first programming job 
with the baseball website Pitcher List, doing data science and analysis. I eventually transitioned
into an API developer role, helping to build upon and maintain our Flask APIs. My experience in these
positions helped me land my first full-time coding job at Hamilton, where I learned an entirely new suite
of tools and technology like C# and Azure.

I've spent the last two years fully immersed in the Microsoft ecosystem, spending 40 hours a week
in Visual Studio building and debugging ASP.NET Core Web APIs, as well as managing the deployment
of those APIs to our Azure VM. On top of refactoring our legacy codebase; I also assisted in the
refactoring of large parts of our database; for example, I pivoted tables that held various
application settings as category-name-value pairs into distinct tables based on category, which
helped enforce stricter type constraints.

As a manufacturing company first and foremost, much of the code I worked with at Hamilton dealt
with kiosks that sent code to and from our APIs. This meant much time spent testing changes in 
our APIs directly at testing kiosks we had setup in our lab, as well as coordinating changes with
the electrical engineers on our team. In short, I feel like my experience at Hamilton (as well as 
at Pitcher List) has not only set me up for success in a position such as the one I'm applying for,
but has also instilled in me the confidence that I could tackle anything new thrown my way. 

I'm eager for a new opportunity and new challenges, and hope this finds you well. Best,

Jeff
